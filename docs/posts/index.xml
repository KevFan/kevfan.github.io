      <description>Motivation Some time ago, while working on a college assignment using Javalin, I encountered some labs that required running SQL statements manually on the database before deploying the application to Heroku. This was a tedious task that had to be repeated every time there were changes or additions to the tables. Although I knew about Flyway and its ability to automate database migrations, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any tutorial on the Javalin site that explained how to use it.</description>
