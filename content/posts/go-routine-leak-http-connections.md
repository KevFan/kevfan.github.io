## Motivation
While working on a Go service, I encountered an intriguing problem: a goroutine leak caused by unclosed HTTP connections. This issue was challenging to reproduce as it only occurred when a specific service utilized [Resty](https://github.com/go-resty/resty) and custom [HTTP transport options](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Transport) while interacting with our service. Delving deeper into the intricacies of managing HTTP connections, I realized the criticality of diligently checking and managing these connections. This blog post aims to shed light on this problem and emphasize the importance of managing HTTP connections to prevent goroutine leaks. By understanding the underlying mechanisms and implementing appropriate strategies, developers can ensure optimal performance and stability in their Go applications.

## Introduction
HTTP connections are a fundamental part of web communication, enabling clients to interact with servers and exchange data. However, when dealing with long-running applications or high-frequency request scenarios, improper management of HTTP connections can lead to goroutine leaks, causing performance issues and resource exhaustion.

In this blog post, we will explore a real-world scenario where a Go service experienced goroutine leaks due to unclosed HTTP connections. We will analyze the problem and identify the crucial role played by correct transport options in both the server and client components. By understanding the significance of managing HTTP connections and implementing best practices, we can mitigate goroutine leaks and ensure the efficient operation of our Go applications.

## The Problem
Our journey begins with a Go service that exhibited a Go routine leak. We initially struggled to identify the root cause, as the leak occurred selectively and only when a particular service, employing Resty and custom HTTP transport options, interacted with our service. Through meticulous investigation and debugging, we discovered that the unresponsiveness and resource consumption were the direct results of unclosed HTTP connections due to using their own `Transport` object that governed the behavior of the Resty HTTP client.

For example:

```go
// Create a new Resty client
client := resty.New()

// Set transport options
transport := &http.Transport{}

client.SetTransport(transport)
```

The issue with this is that default values are assigned to the `Transport` struct unless explicitly defined. One critical field is `IdleConnTimeout time.Duration`, which defaults to zero. According to the Go documentation:

```go
// IdleConnTimeout is the maximum amount of time an idle
// (keep-alive) connection will remain idle before closing
// itself.
// Zero means no limit.
IdleConnTimeout time.Duration
```

This means that connections remain open indefinitely, leading to the goroutine leak on both the client and service sides. This problem only manifested due to the usage of custom  `Transport` options, as Resty's default `Transport` struct has [these and multiple fields defined](https://github.com/go-resty/resty/blob/master/transport.go#L17-L35), which would have prevented this issue.

## Solution 1: Setting Server Response Headers to Close Connetion
The problem was tackled in two steps. First, we immediately addressed this issue in our service. We requested the clients to close the connection upon receiving a response by setting the response headers, as shown below:
```go
// Set the response header to request clients to close the connection after receiving a response
w.Header().Set("Connection", "close")
```
This would cause the client to explicitly close their connection after receiving a response from our service, preventing the goroutine leak in our service.

However, the root cause lies in the client service, which we will address in the next section.

## Solution 2: Setting Idle Connection Timeout
To address the goroutine leak caused by unclosed HTTP connections, we must configure the correct transport options. In our case, the solution involved configuring the `Transport` object in the client service to set an idle connection timeout. By setting an idle connection timeout, we ensure that idle connections are closed after a specific duration, freeing up system resources and preventing accumulation.

```go
// Create a new Resty client
client := resty.New()

// Set transport options
transport := &http.Transport{
	IdleConnTimeout:   time.Second,
}
client.SetTransport(transport)

// Send the HTTP request
// ...
```

By correctly configuring the transport options, we effectively manage HTTP connections, preventing leaks and ensuring the optimal performance and stability of our application.

## Source Code
You can find a sample project on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/KevFan/resty-go-routine-http-connection-leak) for reference. This project demonstrates how a goroutine leak can occur in both the server and client if HTTP connections are not managed effectively. It also showcases potential implementations to address the issue.


## Conclusion
Managing HTTP connections is a critical aspect of developing robust and efficient Go applications. Failure to handle connections properly can result in goroutine leaks, performance degradation, and resource exhaustion. The real-world scenario we explored in this blog post highlighted the importance of setting correct transport options to prevent goroutine leaks caused by unclosed HTTP connections.

In conclusion, this blog post emphasized the significance of setting correct transport options in managing HTTP connections in Go applications. It demonstrated the importance of identifying and resolving goroutine leaks caused by unclosed connections and provided insights into implementing the appropriate solutions. By applying these practices, developers can create reliable, high-performing Go applications that efficiently handle HTTP connections and mitigate potential issues.
